<h3>Why should you hire me as a tutor?</h3>
<p><b>Professional and Academic Experience</b></p>
<ul>
<li>I have 22 months of industry experience, over 10 of which were spent directly in the security field.</li>
<li>At my most recent internship with Accenture, a consulting firm, I was on a Security Operations Centre team for a government client. Some of my activities there included compiling daily <a href = "https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/threat-intelligence/">threat intelligence</a> briefings, conducting incident investigations and response, and automating legacy processes.</li>
<li>At Accenture, I was also part of a cyber-reading club where I had the chance to discuss and debate cybersecurity topics with some really knowledgeable people from MIT, NYU, Carnegie Mellon University, etc on a weekly basis.</li>
<li>Before that I had worked for a Toronto-based firm where I built a Security Information and event management (SIEM) system from the ground up, conducted threat assessments, and deployed Machine Learning algorithms to catch possible intruders.</li>
<li>I have already completed EECS 4481 (3482 is a prerequisite for that, but I was allowed to enrol because of my industry experience) with an A.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Tutoring Experience</b></p>
<p>I have 2 years of tutoring experience during which I have worked with students from Grade 1 all the up to second year university. (Teaching fractions is way harder than teaching integral calculus in case you're wondering.)</p>
