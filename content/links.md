- [World Capitals Voronoi](https://www.jasondavies.com/maps/voronoi/capitals/)
> World territories have been redrawn so that a region is determined by the closest capital city. This is calculated using a spherical Voronoi diagram, which takes into account the curvature of the Earth when computing distances.

Jason has an entire section dedicated to [maps](https://www.jasondavies.com/maps/) on his website. Something mildly interesting I noticed while looking at [World Airports Voronoi](https://www.jasondavies.com/maps/voronoi/airports/) is that the cells for Lester B Pearson (YYZ) and Billy Bishop (YTZ) airports in Toronto have nearly similar areas. 

- [The Canal Papers](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/the-canal-papers) by Scott Alexander. 
   - The review, especially the part about using information processing technologies (telephone switchboard, computers, neural nets) as a metaphor for the brain reminded me of one of my favourite electives in uni - [PHIL-2160](http://www.kevinlande.com/uploads/2/2/9/7/22978190/2160_syllabus__red_.pdf), taughy by the wonderful [Dr. Kevin Lande](http://www.kevinlande.com/).
      - Alison Gopnik, author of one of the assigned readings for the course, was recently on the [Ezra Klein Show](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/podcasts/ezra-klein-podcast-alison-gopnik-transcript.html).

- The [Fast](https://patrickcollison.com/fast) section on Patrick Collison's website.
